# 🧠 Terminal Story — A Different Kind of CV

> _"Instead of telling you about my skills, let me show you a story."_

## 🗒️ About the Project

One day, I sat down intending to write my CV — just like everyone else. But then a thought hit me:

> _"How often do people actually read an entire CV?"_

That's when I decided to build something more... human. Or maybe more robotic.

Rather than writing a traditional resume, I created a **terminal-based program** that presents my skills as a **narrative**. What began as a showcase of my technical abilities slowly turned into a quirky story about a **lonely robot** trying to understand itself.

So no, this isn’t your usual CV.  
It’s part biography, part code demo, part digital diary.

And the best part? I plan to make it available as a standalone website soon, so others can experience it too.
